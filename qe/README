This directory contains few routines of Quantum ESPRESSO that need to
be modified to be used in thermo_pw.

Presently they are:

electrons_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
                 slaves that need further work at each electron iteration.

solve_linter_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
                 slaves that need further work at each phonon iteration.

phqscf_tpw : call solve_linter_tpw instead of solve_linter

prepare_q_tpw: use the variable tcollect_all to avoid the calculation of
the bands in the final run that collects all the dynamical matrices.

run_nscf_tpw : call set_small_group_q also in the lgamma_iq case. This change
               can probably be done also in the phonon, but it is tested here
               before changing qe. Set lscf to .false. because thermo_pw
               reads the input of pw that sets lscf or can do a scf calculation
               that sets this variable.

do_phonon_tpw : call phqscf_tpw instead of phqscf and prepare_q_tpw instead
            of prepare_q.

adddvepsi_us_tpw.f90 : added the number of occupated bands as an input.

ev_xml : is identical to the QE routine, but it is copied here because files
         in the PW/tools directory are not linked to thermo_pw.

read_dyn_from_file : in the routine of PH there is an implicit dependence
         on first. The routine makes two different things if it is called
         for the first time. Since thermo_pw calls this routine for several
         geometry, the first file of each geometry should be considered as
         first. Removed the dependence on first.

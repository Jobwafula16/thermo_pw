This directory contains few routines of Quantum ESPRESSO that need to
be modified to be used in thermo_pw.

Presently they are:

solve_linter_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
                 slaves that need further work at each phonon iteration.

phqscf_tpw : call solve_linter_tpw instead of solve_linter

do_phonon_tpw : call phqscf_tpw instead of phqscf.

This directory contains a collection of inputs of the thermo_pw code.
It is divided in subdirectories. The name of each subdirectory should suggest
its content, but see also below some information.  

After running the script provided in each example, you can see the Brillouin 
zone with the asymptote package (http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/) running
the command:
 
asy -V asy_tmp.asy 

To see the crystal structure you can use the xcrysden package 
(http://www.xcrysden.org/) and read the pw.x input file.

xcrysden --pwi pw_input_file

In order to obtain the other quantities you have to change the 'what' 
variable in the thermo_pw input inside the script.

NB: this directory uses the pseudopotentials of pslibrary.1.0.0. In order
to use it, you must change the PSEUDO_DIR variable (inside the 
environment_variables file in the main QE directory) to point to the 
directory that contains the UPF files of the pseudopotentials for the pz 
or pbe functional.

The b1 structure is the rock salt structure. 
It has a fcc Bravais lattice and two atoms per cell. When one atom
is in the origin, the other is in the center of the cubic
cell (1/2,1/2,1/2) in cartesian coordinates and in units of alat.

The reference directory contains the outputs or postscript files:

asy_tmp.asy :  An asymptote script to plot the Brillouin zone

output_bands.ps : plot of the band structure

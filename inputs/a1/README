The A1 structure has the face centered cubic Bravais lattice and one
atom per cell.

The reference directory contains the outputs or postscript files: 

bz :  Plot of the Brillouin zone and of the structure

bands : plot of the band structure

disp : plot of the phonon dispersion. Note that the experimental data
       are read by modifying the file gnuplot.tmp.g1_disp

The A1 structure has the face centered cubic Bravais lattice and one
atom per cell.

The reference directory contains the outputs or postscript files: 

asy_tmp.asy : asymptote script to plot of the Brillouin zone and of the 
              structure

output_bands.ps : plot of the band structure

output_disp.ps.g1 : plot of the phonon dispersion. Note that the 
       experimental data are read by modifying the file gnuplot.tmp.g1_disp

output_anhar.ps : plot of the anharmonic quantities.

al.el_const.out : an example of the output of the elastic constants run.

!   This example shows how to use the tool program plot_sur_states.x to plot
!   the planar average of the charge density of the states of the slab.
!   It assumes that in the working directory you have the directory dump
!   produced by thermo_pw with the option dump_states=.TRUE. and a file
!   with the energy eigenvalues called output_band.dat. To obtain these two 
!   files run example19 with these options.

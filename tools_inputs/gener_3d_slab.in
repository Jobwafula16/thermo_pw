!  This example shows the use of the code gener_3d_slab.x.
!  This input generates the coordinates of 15 atoms slab of fcc Al 
!  perpendicular to the 111 direction.
!  It writes on output the celldm to simulate this cell with an
!  hexagonal Bravais lattice and the coordinates of all the atoms.
!  The slab is rotated so that the 111 direction becomes the z axis.

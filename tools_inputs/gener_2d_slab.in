!
! This is an example of the input of the gener_2d_slab code.
! This example generates the coordinates of an armchair silicene ribbon 
! with seven layers (14 atoms). The ribbon is inserted in a simple 
! orthorombic cell and is oriented parallel to x.
!
! use the code gener_2d_slab.x < this_input
! use xcrysdens --xsf gener_2d_slab.out.xsf to see the ribbon

!
! To create a 2D sheet simulated by a ribbon with N rows, first discover
! how many rows N_b perpendicular to the given direction are needed.
! In some directions and with some lattices it is not possible to recover
! the 2D sheet.
! If it is possible N_b is written in the output provided that the
! number of rows nrows is larger than N_b. Then create a ribbon with N_b lines,
! put ldist_vacuum=.FALSE. and use a small vacuum distance so the code will
! choose zero layers of vacuum.
! Notice however that if the number of lines is not correct this procedure
! could lead to almost overlapping atoms and a cell that cannot be simulated.

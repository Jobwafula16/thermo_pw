!  This example shows the use of the code gener_nanowire.x.
!  This input generates the coordinates of (7, 3) gold nanowire
!  starting from the size a in atomic unit of the 2d hexagonal mesh.
!  It writes on output the celldm to simulate this wire with a
!  tetragonal Bravais lattice and 74 atoms.
!
!  The 2d Bravais lattices are
!  1 - oblique
!  2 - rectangular
!  3 - centered rectangular
!  4 - square
!  5 - hexagonal
!
!  The sheet is composed of all the atoms between
!  C = m a1 + n a2  and
!  T = p a1 + q a2
!
!  Note that the size of the box is along z (distance between sheets)
!  if lwire=.FALSE. or along x and y if lwire=.TRUE. The nanowire is 
!  wrapped along C and has height nz |T| along z.

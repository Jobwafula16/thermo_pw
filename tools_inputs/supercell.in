!
!  This example shows the use of the code supercell.x. 
!  This input generates the coordinates of 3 Bi_2Te_3 quintuple layers
!  starting from their Wyckoff positions and space group.
!  It writes on output the celldm to simulate this cell with an
!  hexagonal Bravais lattice and 15 atoms. 
!  Set iconv=0 if you want the output to simulate the system with 
!  5 atoms and a rhombohedral cell.
!
!  This input can be used with:
!  supercell.x < supercell.in
!  The output appear on the standard output. An .xsf file called supercell.xsf
!  is also created to see the supercell:
!  xcrysdens  --xsf supercell.xsf

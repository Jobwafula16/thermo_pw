This is the distribution of the thermo_pw package. This program is
a driver to compute the physical properties of materials, using 
Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) (see http://www.quantum-espresso.org) routines 
as the underlying engine.
All quantities calculated by thermo_pw can be calculated also by the
QE package with more effort. thermo_pw decreases the number of steps 
necessary to obtain a postscript picture of selected properties. See the 
Doc/user_guide.pdf file for a list of the quantities presently available 
in thermo_pw. 
The package can run on parallel machines. In addition to the standard 
QE parallelization schemes thermo_pw can use the image parallelization 
to parallelize as much as possible the different tasks, but it can also 
run with a single image.

Thermo_pw is much less flexible than QE and probably after using it
you may want to pass to QE for the more sophisticated tasks, but for the most
common tasks, such as the calculation of band structures, of phonon
dispersions, or for the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of
materials, thermo_pw can be much easier to learn and faster to use, requiring
much less information from the user.

Note that this software is still experimental.

Quick installation instructions:

Put this directory inside the main Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) directory.
Enter here and type 

make join_qe

Go again in the main QE directory and type

./configure
make thermo_pw

Now you should have the file thermo_pw.x in the QE/bin directory and
you can run the examples.

Complete installation instructions and short description of the
functionalities: See the Doc/user_guide.pdf.

Uninstal:
Enter in this directory and type
make leave_qe
Then remove this directory.

NB: This code changes a few files of the QE distribution (mainly makefiles). 
Only after typing make leave_qe you recover the original QE distribution. If
you just remove the thermo_pw directory the files of QE package remain 
modified.

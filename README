This is the distribution of the thermo_pw package. This program is
a driver to compute rapidly the physical properties of materials, 
using the Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) (see http://www.quantum-espresso.org)
routines as the underlying electronic structure code.
Almost all quantities calculated here can be calculated also by the
QE package. Thermo_pw decreases the number of steps necessary to obtain 
a postscript picture of some quantities. See the Doc/README file for a list
of the quantities presently available in thermo_pw. The package is optimized
for parallel machines. In addition to the standard QE parallelization schemes
thermo_pw uses, in many cases, the image parallelization to parallelize as 
much as possible the different tasks, but it can also run with a single
image.
Thermo_pw is much less flexible than QE and probably after using it
you may want to pass to QE for the more sophisticated tasks, but for the most
common tasks, such as the calculation of band structures, of phonon
dispersions, or for the calculation of the thermodynamical properties of
materials, thermo_pw can be much easier to learn and faster to use, requiring
a much reduced number of information from the user.

Installation instructions:
   Put the thermo_pw directory inside the QE main directory. 
   Enter in the thermo_pw directory and give the following commands
   cp ./main_Makefile ../Makefile
   cp ./plugins_makefile ../install
   cd ..
   make thermo_pw

The executable thermo_pw.x will be found in the bin directory of QE.
Note that the main Makefile and the file plugin-install of the QE distribution
are modified by these instuctions, so you may want to save them before 
installing thermo_pw.

Please see the Doc directory for a description of the package and of its
capabilities and the examples directory to find some scripts that illustrate
the use of the code.

To uninstall the package, just remove the thermo_pw directory and restore
the QE Makefile and plugins_makefile.

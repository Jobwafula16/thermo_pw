This is the distribution of the thermo_pw package. This program is
a driver to compute rapidly the most common physical properties of materials, 
using the Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) (see http://www.quantum-espresso.org)
routines as the underlying engine.
All quantities calculated by thermo_pw can be calculated also by the
QE package. Thermo_pw decreases the number of steps necessary to obtain 
a postscript picture of some quantities. See the Doc/user_guide.pdf file 
for a list of the quantities presently available in thermo_pw. The package 
can run on parallel machines. In addition to the standard QE parallelization 
schemes thermo_pw can use the image parallelization to parallelize as 
much as possible the different tasks, but it can also run with a single
image.
Thermo_pw is much less flexible than QE and probably after using it
you may want to pass to QE for the more sophisticated tasks, but for the most
common tasks, such as the calculation of band structures, of phonon
dispersions, or for the calculation of the thermodynamical properties of
materials, thermo_pw can be much easier to learn and faster to use, requiring
a much reduced number of information from the user.

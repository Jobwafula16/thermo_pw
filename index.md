<br><br>
Thermo_pw is a set of Fortran drivers for the parallel and/or automatic 
computation of materials properties using Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) routines 
as the underlying engine. It provides an alternative organization of the 
QE work-flow for the most common tasks exploiting, when possible, 
an asynchronous image parallelization. Moreover, the code has a set of 
pre-processing tools to reduce the user input information and a set of 
post-processing tools to produce plots directly comparable with experiment.

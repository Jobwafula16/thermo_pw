Thermo_pw is a driver for the calculation of thermodynamic quantities,
using the harmonic and/or quasiharmonic approximation and the
plane waves pseudopotential method. At low level it uses the QE routines
to perform the calculations. The calculations made by thermo_pw can be
done by using bash scripts or other scripting languages. 
The advantage of writing the scripts in fortran is that the calculations 
can be parallelized among different images that are sent asyncrounously 
and controlled by the master image. 
It reads the input of pwscf and an input that specifies
which calculations to do and the parameters for these calculations.
It checks the scratch directories to see what has been already
calculated. The info for the quantities that have been already
calculated is read inside the code. The others tasks are scheduled,
their priorities determined, and distributed to the image driver.
If there are several available images the different tasks are
carried out in parallel when possible. This driver can carry out a scf 
calculation, a non scf calculation to determine the band structure,
or a linear response calculation at a given q and for a given
representation. Finally the root image can carry out several
post processing tasks. The task currently implemented are:

scf           : a single scf calculation to determine the total energy.
scf_ke        : test of the dependence of the energy on the wavefunctions
                and density cut-off energy.
scf_nk        : test of the dependence of the energy on the k point sampling
                and on the smearing.  
scf_bands     : a band structure calculation after a scf calculation.
scf_ph        : a phonon at a single q after a scf run.
scf_disp      : a phonon dispersion calculation after a scf run.
                This option can calculate the vibrational energy, free energy,
                entropy, and constant volume specific heat after the phonon 
                calculation.
mur_lc        : equilibrium lattice constant via murnaghan equation.
mur_lc_bands  : a band structure calculation at the minimum or the
                murnaghan.
mur_lc_ph     : a phonon calculation at a single q at the minimum of the 
                murnaghan.
mur_lc_disp   : a dispersion calculation at the minimum of the murnaghan with 
                the possibility to compute harmonic thermodynamical quantities.
mur_lc_t      : lattice constant and bulk modulus as a function of temperature 
                within the quasiharmonic approximation.

\section{\color{coral}Introduction}
This guide discusses the internal organization of \tpw. It is not necessary
to read it to use \tpw. It contains some technical information not 
appropriate for the user's guide.
It assumes that you have read and understood the user's guide and that
you have already some familiarity with the input variables and 
the working modes of the \tpw\ code.

\section{\color{coral}People}
This guide has been written by Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA - Trieste). 

\newpage
\section{\color{coral}Overview}
\tpw\ is logically divided into parts. In some parts the different
images run asynchronously doing different tasks and in some parts the
run is synchronous. Usually in this synchronous parts results are 
collected and only the first image is actually doing the work while
the other images are blocked waiting for the results.
Presently \tpw\ has two asynchronous runs each one followed
by one or more synchronous parts. The parts that are activated in
each run depend on the input variable \texttt{what}. After reading the input,
and writing some summary, the code calls the routine 
\texttt{initialize\_thermo\_work} that sets all the
logical flags that control the global run and the first asynchronous
part. The first asynchronous part (A) makes \texttt{nwork} \texttt{pw.x} 
calculations in parallel in each image. 
Then the following synchronous part makes one or more of
the following calculations:
\begin{itemize}

\item
B) \texttt{lconv\_ke\_test=.TRUE.} writes and plots the total
energy as a function of the kinetic energy.

\item
C) \texttt{lconv\_nk\_test=.TRUE.} writes and plots the total energy
as a function of the {\bf k}-points set.

\item
D) \texttt{lev\_syn\_1=.TRUE.} makes a Murnaghan fit of the 
total energy/enthalpy as a function of the unit cell volume or 
a quadratic fit of the total energy / enthalpy as a function of the crystal
parameters and determines the minimum energy geometry.

\item
E) \texttt{lpwscf\_syn\_1=.TRUE.} makes a self-consistent \texttt{pw.x} 
calculation.

\item
F) \texttt{lband\_syn\_1=.TRUE.} makes a non self-consistent \texttt{pw.x}
calculation to compute the band structure.

\end{itemize}

The second part can have an asynchronous part in which
many \texttt{pw.x} calculations are made (\texttt{lpart2\_pw=.TRUE.}) (G1)
or a loop of asynchronous phonon runs (G2), one for each geometry calculated
in A or at the minimum energy/enthalpy geometry
found in D whose self-consistent calculation has been done in E.
The G2 run is controlled by \texttt{lph=.TRUE.} and by 
\texttt{tot\_ngeo} which is the number of geometries. For each geometry 
one can calculate the phonon dispersions, the phonon dos and the 
harmonic thermodynamic quantities. The geometry to do is controlled only 
changing the \texttt{outdir} directory where the phonon run finds the
files produced by the \texttt{pw.x} calculation. The final collection
of the dynamical matrices, calculations of the phonon dispersions, phonon 
dos and harmonic thermodynamic quantities are done in a synchronous way 
within the loop over the geometries.

Following G1 or G2 there is another synchronous part. 
After G1 the synchronous part will do one of the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item
H) \texttt{lelastic\_const=.TRUE.} elastic constants calculations.

\item
I) \texttt{lpiezoelectric\_tensor=.TRUE.} piezoelectric tensor calculation.

\item
L) \texttt{lpolarization=.TRUE.} polarization calculation.

\end{itemize}

After G2, depending on \texttt{what} the synchronous part will do nothing, 
or if the phonons have been computed in several geometries it will do:

\begin{itemize}

\item
M) the interpolation and minimization of the 
Helmholtz or Gibbs free energy at any temperature.

\item
N) Calculation of the Gr\"uneisen parameters on a path over the Brillouin
zone and their plot.

\item
O) Calculation of the anharmonic quantities such as the thermal expansion
from the numerical differentiation of the crystal parameters. Calculation
of the isoentropic quantities when programmed.

\item
P) Calculation of the Gr\"uneisen parameters on a uniform mesh of {\bf q} 
points and calculation of the thermal expansion from the Gr\"uneisen parameters.
Calculation of the isoentropic quantities when programmed.

\end{itemize}

\section{\color{coral}Activated parts}

\section{\color{coral}Scripts and Files}

In almost all tasks, \tpw\ produces some data files containing the quantity 
to plot, some scripts to plot the data and, if the \texttt{gnuplot} code
is available, the postscript files with the plot of the data. So for each 
task there is an associated routine
that writes the output data and a routine that plots the output data
writing the \texttt{gnuplot} script. Usually the name of the routine that
writes the data starts with \texttt{write\_} and the routine that plots
the data is called \texttt{plot\_}. The following is a list of the routines
that write and plot the data and the name of the associated files
containing the data, the scripts and the postscript files.

\section{\color{coral}Library}

\tpw\ offers a library of modules to deal with solid properties. The 
modules are independent from the \tpw\ variables, but might
depend on the \qe\ modules. They are used by the routines of \tpw\ 
but can also be used by independent programs such as those contained
in the \texttt{tools} directory. Presently the library contains the
following modules:

Presently there is a routine to calculate the primitive cell of
a given centered cell.

\item
\texttt{latgen\_2d.f90} contains routines to deal with two dimensional
Bravais lattices. Presently it contains the routines to generate the

point groups. Given a representation of a given group it can find 
the subgroups representations that correspond to it (also for
double groups). It has the same conventions as the routines

\texttt{divide\_class\_so.f90} of \qe.

\item
\texttt{eldos\_module.f90} contains routines to calculate the electronic
excitation energy, free energy, entropy, and constant strain heat capacity
from the electronic density of states, assuming a gas of independent 
electrons.   

\item
\texttt{ph\_freq\_module.f90} contains routines to calculate the vibrational
energy, free energy, entropy, and constant strain heat capacity from the

compliances, the bulk moduli, the sound speeds or the Voigt-Reuss-Hill 
averages. It has also routines to transform from the Voigt to the 
tensorial notation and viceversa.

\item

temperature, the vibrational energy, free-energy, and entropy according
to the Debye's model.

\item
\texttt{quadratic\_surfaces.f90} contains routines to fit a set of data
with a quadratic polynomial, to find the gradient or the hessian in 
a given point and to find the minimum of the quadratic function. 
The number of independent variables can vary from one to six.

\item
\texttt{quartic\_surfaces.f90} contains routines to fit a set of data
with a quartic polynomial, to find the gradient or the hessian in 
a given point and to find the minimum of the quartic function given a 
reasonably good guess of its position.
The number of independent variables can vary from one to six.

\item
\texttt{linear\_solvers.f90} contains routines that solve iteratively
a linear system. 

\item

\item
\texttt{gnuplot\_color.f90} contains routines to insert the color names
inside the \texttt{gnuplot} scripts.

\end{itemize}
